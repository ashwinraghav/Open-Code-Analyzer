        Code Lounge is a site that can help you take the opinion of other ThoughtWorkers on whether or not the code your reviewing should be pursued.
        The feed back is instant. Yep! Thats right. The tool can intelligently predict what your fellow ThoughtWorkers would have felt about the code.
        However, the toold leaves the options of passing/pursuing the code to you and it is important that you do this. This way, the tool can learn
        your likes and dislikes and can predict your opinion on other submissions. Use it as a guide. Make your own decisions!
